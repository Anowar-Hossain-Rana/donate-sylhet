        <h3>Food for a family</h3>
        <p class="package-descript-text">
            The burden of flood damage has to be borne more by the marginalized people. The middle class today has become the lower class and the poorest of the poor. And the condition of the extremely poor is unspeakable. Due to the ongoing floods, many people will have to go hungry if the necessary financial help does not reach these people in time.

        <h3>Education for a child</h3>
        <p class="package-descript-text">
            Children who can't participate in remote learning because they live in homes with no electricity, internet or the necessary technology to download or access online lessons are entirely left behind 
            Younger children or those who were already below grade level are at greater risk of lifelong poverty. They also have lower life expectancy and poorer health outcomes 
            Across the board, children's health suffers. In many parts of the world, school is where children get health care, immunizations and their one nutritious meal of the day  
            Children who experience abuse, neglect or dysfunctional parenting at home suffer the double trauma of being cut off from supportive teachers and friends

    <p>The flood waters have entered the haor area of the country for more than two weeks. The water hasn't fully drained yet. In the meantime, low-lying areas of some districts of the northern region and Padmapar are flooded, but the water has receded from there. But due to the two-week-long rain in Uzan, the water of four rivers in the haor area of the country, including Sylhet, is still flowing above the boundary.
    The government's flood forecasting and warning centre has sounded some hope. Experts say the flood waters in the haor area of the country are also expected to recede in the next two to three days. As a result, the organization believes that there is no more flood water in most parts of the country before Eid.
